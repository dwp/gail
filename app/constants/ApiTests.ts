    "### Universal Credit Support for Care Leavers\n\n#### Housing Support\n- Local authorities must provide housing support for 16 or 17-year-old care leavers until they turn 18.\n- Care leavers under 25 years old can receive help with accommodation costs.\n- It's crucial to identify care leavers early to ensure they receive the correct support and to apply necessary requirements.\n\n#### Education Support\n- Care leavers can undertake full-time non-advanced education while receiving Universal Credit until they reach the age of 21 or until the end of the academic year in which they reach the age of 21.\n- This is known as Second Chance Learning and allows care leavers to make up for missed education due to time spent in care.\n- While in non-advanced education, care leavers are placed in the No Work-Related Requirements regime, and during summer vacation, they are placed in the Labour Market regime based on individual circumstances.\n\n#### Additional Support\n- Care leavers are eligible for advances when making a new claim and can prepare their claim up to 28 days before their 18th birthday.\n- They can also receive money guidance, alternative payment arrangements, and recoverable hardship payments.\n- Access to the Work and Health Programme is available for care leavers to support their engagement in education and employment.",

This includes:\n\n* National Qualification Framework level 3 or the Scottish Qualification framework level 6\n* A Level or Scottish equivalent\n* AS Level or Scottish equivalent\n* Advanced Diploma\n* National Diploma certificate or award\n* Level 3 National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) award, certificate or diploma\n\nWhilst in non-advanced education, the care leaver will be in the [No Work-Related Requirements regime](https://intranet.dwp.gov.uk/policy/no-work-related-requirements-regime).\n\nDuring the summer vacation, the claimant is placed in the [Labour Market regime](https://intranet.dwp.gov.uk/policy/glance-labour-market-regimes#LMregimes) based on their individual circumstances (as if they were not in education or training at that time).\n\n## Accommodation costs\n\nThe local authority must provide support for 16 or 17-year old care leavers with housing costs until they are 18 years old. ...\n\n\n# Extract 2:\n...leavers\n\nIt is important that care leavers are identified as soon as possible to ensure they receive the correct support and for the switching-off of requirements (easements) to be applied.\n\nThe Government is committed to improving the outcomes for care leavers, particularly with regard to engaging in education and employment. Claimants who are identified as care leavers must be made aware of all the relevant support that is available to them whilst receiving Universal Credit. This includes:\n\n* [Advances](#Advanced claim preparation for a care leaver) when making a new claim\n* [Money guidance and Alternative Payment Arrangements](https://intranet.dwp.gov.uk/policy/money-guidance-and-alternative-payment-arrangements-0) at any point during their claim\n* undertaking [full-time non-advanced education](#Full-time Non-advanced education for care leavers)\n* [Recoverable Hardship Payments](https://intranet.dwp.gov.uk/policy/recoverable-hardship-payments)\n* help with accommodation costs, if they are under 25 years old\n* access to the [Work and Health Programme](https://intranet.dwp.gov.uk/policy/work-and-health-programme)\n\n## Advanced claim preparation for a care leaver\n\nCare leavers can prepare their claim to Universal Credit up to 28 days before and including their 18th birthday, although the claim details must not be submitted until their 18th birthday. This helps to ensure support is in place as early as possible.\n\nThe care leaver can also make a pre-claim appointment to confirm details such as identity and bank account details.

For more information, see [Spotlight on: care leavers](https://intranet.dwp.gov.uk/policy/spotlight-care-leavers-0).\n\nWhen care leaver status has been confirmed, this must be recorded in the Claimant Profile. \n\n## Why we support care leavers\n\nCare leavers are young people who will usually have complex needs. This means that they require access to additional support. Children enter residential or foster care for many reasons and their past experiences can very often have a negative impact on adult life. Therefore, care leavers are more likely to be at risk of:\n\n* poor educational outcomes\n* unemployment\n* being [homeless](https://intranet.dwp.gov.uk/policy/homelessness-and-risk-homelessness-guidance)\n* [drug and alcohol dependency](https://intranet.dwp.gov.uk/policy/drug-and-alcohol-dependency)\n* offending\n* mental health issues\n\n## Support for care leavers\n\nIt is important that care leavers are identified as soon as possible to ensure they receive the correct support and for the switching-off of requirements (easements) to be applied.\n\nThe Government is committed to improving the outcomes for care leavers, particularly with regard to engaging in education and employment.

A [Word version](/file/909484/download/Word%2520version.docx) of the transcript is also available.\n\n## Transcript\n\n#### Jake:\n\nMy name is Jake and I was taken into care at nine years old. I left last year. Today’s my nineteenth birthday. Only I don’t feel like celebrating, the jobcentre has stopped my money and I’m about to get kicked out of my flat.\n\nI haven’t had a hot meal in six days. I was doing health and social care at college because I wanted to be a social worker but the jobcentre told me that I can’t do that course and they’ve stopped my money.\n\n#### Narrator:\n\nCare leavers are allowed to undertake full time, non-advanced education up to the age of twenty-one and still claim Universal Credit. This is known as a second chance learning and it allows care leavers to make up for some of the education they have missed out on due to time spent in care.\n\n#### Jake:\n\nI found this year tough. I‘ve never had to manage my own rent or bills before, Social Services have always done it for me. I get really stressed having to sort my rent out and make sure that I’ve got enough money to get by on. I literally have no one else to support me, I’m now behind on my rent and my landlord keeps sending me letters. I’m finding it hard to cope and I don’t know what to do.\n\n#### Narrator:\n\nCare leavers may need additional support with managing their money. You must consider signposting the young person for budgeting advice at any point in their claim. Leaving care is a Tier One factor for considering an alternative payment arrangement or APA. It is absolutely imperative that a conversation is held around APAs with care leavers at every intervention.\n\n#### Jake:\n\nWhen I went to the jobcentre for my first appointment I had no idea how I would manage five weeks to my first payment. The work coach told me that I could get a Universal Credit advance, only I had no ID, so the person on the phone told me ‘No’.\n\n#### Work coach: ...",
